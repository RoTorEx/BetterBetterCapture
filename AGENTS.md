# AGENTS.md

Keep this file a short context router. Put product truth in `BUSINESS.md` and
focused `business/*` modules instead of expanding this file.

## Kernel routing

<!-- VIBE:KERNEL_ROUTING_START -->

This project uses committed local copies of the Vibecoding Kernel.

- Always read `.vibe/kernel/OPERATING.md` and choose its maintenance, operation,
  or audit mode before normal project work.
- For version, tag, publish, or release work, also read
  `.vibe/kernel/RELEASE.md`.
- For user corrections, instruction conflicts, reusable agent-workflow lessons,
  kernel proposals, or a newly pulled kernel version, also read
  `.vibe/kernel/EVOLUTION.md`.
- For product behavior or domain logic, read `BUSINESS.md` and only the relevant
  module from `business/*`.
- Do not edit `.vibe/kernel/*` manually or read the parent kernel during normal
  work. Refresh the local copy with `make vibe-pull`.
- When a reusable workflow improvement belongs in the parent, run
  `make vibe-propose`; it appends a reviewable proposal without changing rules.

<!-- VIBE:KERNEL_ROUTING_END -->

## Local routing

- Read `business/PRODUCT.md` for recording behavior, privacy, automation, or
  user-visible product changes.
- Read `business/ENGINEERING.md` for Swift, SwiftUI, SwiftData, project
  structure, testing, dependency, or build-system changes.
- Read `business/OPERATIONS.md` for fork/upstream, GitHub, release, website, or
  repository-maintenance work.
- Treat `origin` as this fork and `upstream` as the original BetterCapture
  project. Never push to `upstream` or rewrite fork history without an explicit
  user request.
- Never publish a GitHub Release, sign/notarize artifacts, or deploy the website
  unless the user explicitly requests that exact external action.
- Preserve durable user explanations and corrections in the appropriate local
  source of truth during the same task.
- Use `.vibe/kernel/EVOLUTION.md` for reusable workflow feedback; never block a
  local fix while waiting for a parent-kernel decision.
- Add routing here only when it prevents repeated mistakes or unnecessary
  context loading.
